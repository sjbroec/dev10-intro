        <h2><em>Restaurant Description</em></h2>

          <p>Jeffy D's was founded in 2010 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. Tired of the average pancake house and fast food options, Jeff Palacio introduced fast-casual breakfast option to the market while maintaining that diner-feel. His concept brought together his favorite meal of the day and his favorite way to eat. Using a familiar layout, he was able to create a healthy, customizable way to eat breakfast all day long! </p>
          <p> Now more than 500 restaurants strong, Jeffy D's is thriving. Each restaurant features more than 2000 customizable flavor combinations and allows you to choose your own breakfast adventure.</p>
